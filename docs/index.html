<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is the Bill of Material for a replica Amiga 1000 Rejuvenator. It is optimized for <a href="https://github.com/joethezombie/Amiga-1000-Rejuvenator">joethezombie&rsquo;s Amiga 1000 Rejuvenator Re-creation Project</a>.</p>
<h2>Read Me First!</h2>
<p>If you want to build your own Rejuvenator, be aware that you are dealing with technology from the last century.</p>
<p>While almost all of the standard components are still available, some components are rare by now. You will need <em>all</em> of the listed components (except of those marked optional). We recommend that you try to get the components marked as <span class="rare">Rare</span> first, so you won&rsquo;t waste your money on standard components if you fail to get all the rare ones.</p>
<p>Also, installing the Rejuvenator into your Amiga 1000 is a very difficult process. Once you&rsquo;ve done it, you definitely won&rsquo;t want to try again. We recommend to read the installation manual first (link see below).</p>
<h2>Rare Parts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RAM</strong>: You can use any 44256 type DRAM with a 256Kx4 organization and an access time of 120ns or faster. You can use either 4 or 8 chips, for 512KB or 1MB of Chip RAM. If 4 chips are used, they are seated in U6, U8, U10, U12. An easy way to get them is to purchase a used Amiga 500 memory expansion with 4 chips. You can also reuse the OKI clock chip from that expansion.</li>
<li><strong>OKI 6242B</strong>: These chips can still be found as NOS part at online marketplaces.</li>
<li><strong>EPROM</strong>: You can use 512KB x 16 bit EPROMs like AM27C400 or MX27C4100. They can still be found as NOS parts at online marketplaces. If the Kickstart image is 256KB big, duplicate it when burning it to a 512KB EPROM.</li>
<li><strong>Agnus</strong>: You will need a Fat Agnus in a PLCC-84 package.</li>
<li><strong>Denise</strong>: Can be reused from your Amiga 1000, or replaced with an ECS Denise.</li>
<li><strong>Paula</strong>: Can be reused from your Amiga 1000.</li>
<li><strong>PAL 16L8</strong>: They can be replaced with ATF16V8 GALs that are still in production.</li>
<li><strong>PAL 20L8</strong>: They can be replaced with ATF20V8 or ATF22V10 GALs. The ATF22V10 type is still in production. Adapted fusemaps for that type are provided.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assembly and Installation</h2>
<ul>
<li>The fusemaps for the GALs <a href="https://github.com/joethezombie/Amiga-1000-Rejuvenator/tree/master/PLD/Rejuvenator">can be found here</a>.</li>
<li>For assembly see the <a href="http://amiga.resource.cx/manual/Rejuvenator.pdf">original installation manual</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?t=749">See here</a> about how to expand the Rejuvenator to 2MB of Chip RAM.</li>
</ul>
